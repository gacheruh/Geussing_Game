Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game where the program generates a random number between 0 and 10, and the user has to guess the number. The user is given 3 chances to guess the number correctly. If the user guesses the secret number correctly, the program stops and "You Won!!" is printed on the screen. If the user guesses a wrong number, "Try again" is printed on the screen, and the user is given another chance to try again. After the 3 trials are over and the user still hasn't guessed the secret number completely, the secret number is printed on the screen.
